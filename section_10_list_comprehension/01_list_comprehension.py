# List Comprehension

"""
COMPREHENSION:
    --> Comprehensions in Python provide us with a short and concise way to construct new sequences (such as lists, set, dictionary etc.) using sequences which have been already defined. Python supports the following 4 types of comprehensions:
        --> List Comprehensions
        --> Dictionary Comprehensions
        --> Set Comprehensions
        --> Generator Comprehensions
"""

"""
LIST COMPREHENSION:
    --> List comprehension is an elegant way to define and create lists based on existing lists.
    --> [expression(n); for n in list(n)]
    --> We can use conditional(if-else) in comprehension for complex conversion.
    --> Remember, every list comprehension can be rewritten in for loop, but every for loop canâ€™t be rewritten in the form of list comprehension.
