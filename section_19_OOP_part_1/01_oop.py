OOP:
    --> OOP is a method of programming that attempts to model some process or thing in the world as a class or object.
    --> With object oriented programming, the goal is to encapsulate the code into logical, hierarchical grouping using classes so that you can reason about your code at a higher level.
    --> Class:
            --> A blueprint for objects. Classes can contain methods(functions) and attributes(similar to keys in a dict).
    --> instance:
            --> objects that are constructed from a class blueprint that contain their class' methods and properties.
    --> Encapsulation:
            --> The grouping of pulic and private attributes and methods into a programmatic class, making `absctraction` possible.
    --> Abstraction:
            --> Exposing only 'relevant' data in a class interface, hiding private attributes and methods (aka the 'inner workings') from users.
